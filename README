Description
-----------

This is the Perl 5 News-Scan distribution.  It requires perl version 5.004
or later.

This distribution provides a mechanism for collecting articles from a
set of Usenet newsgroups and then creating statistical reports about
those groups.

This release of News-Scan is incompatible with prior releases.  This
should be considered alpha-quality software, so the internal
implementation is subject to change without notice, although I will
only make incompatible changes only when absolutely necessary.

Prerequisites
-------------

To use NewsScan, you need to have installed the following packages:

    TimeDate-#.##
    MailTools#.##
    IO-#.##

If you want to collect articles from an NNTP server, you'll also need
to install

    libnet-#.##

Installation
------------

Install NewsScan by running the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install

Examples
--------

Please see the eg/ directory after you have unpacked the distribution
for examples of using this library to gather and report statistics for
Usenet newsgroups.
