To Do:
======

o Add a facility for composite statistics (i.e. stats over a month's
  worth of articles from scan's dumps without having to actually save
  an entire's month's worth of articles).

o This should work for mailing lists too.

o Limit News::Scan::collect to only in-range articles (perhaps by
  using XHDR)

o Lots of configurability and hooks

o Probably lots more.. :-(
